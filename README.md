# Rules
## • On the first screen the user must enter two numbers: one is the chess boards’ size, the other is the possible steps the user can make.
## • After clicking on the OK button, we draw a chess table with the given size, and a random selected grid (as the first active cell).
## • The user can move this active cell to any direction by using keyboard’s up/down/left/right arrow keys.
## • After reaching the number of available steps, the chess board must disappear and we must showthe steps were made (the cell coordinates which were active in the game)
